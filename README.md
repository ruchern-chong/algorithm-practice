# algorithm-practice

My own way to learn and practice writing algorithms that are commonly tested during technical interviews. As a non-computer science student with no formal education on this topic, I have to find ways to streamline this process.

These algorithms should only consists of fundamentals for understanding the concepts in regard to time complexity.
